# üéì LMS External Content Auditor & Localizer (for University) - Still Under Developing

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A specialized tool designed for University to scrape its Learning Management System (LMS) environment. It discovers all embedded and linked course materials, analyzes them for external/third-party references, assesses these references against cyber reputation services, and generates reports for LMS subject owners. It also includes an extension to locally cache and reference external content appropriately.

## üéØ Core Problem Addressed

Learning Management Systems (LMS) at institutions like University often contain links and references to third-party websites and resources. These external sites represent uncontrolled content, posing potential risks (malware, inappropriate material, poor reputation) and challenges for content stability and academic referencing. This tool aims to mitigate these issues.

## üåü Features

**Core Functionality:**

*   **Secure LMS Login:** Authenticates with the University LMS to access course content.
*   **Comprehensive Content Discovery:**
    *   Scrapes specified LMS courses to identify all embedded and linked materials (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoints, web links, embedded videos).
    *   Parses discovered materials (documents, HTML pages) to extract all external/third-party URL references.
*   **External Reference Analysis:**
    *   Categorizes and summarizes all unique external references found per LMS subject.
    *   Integrates with a cyber reputation service (e.g., VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing API - *specify which one you'll use*) to assess the risk (malware, bad content, poor reputation) associated with each external URL.
*   **Subject-Specific Reporting:**
    *   Generates detailed reports for each LMS subject owner.
    *   Reports include:
        *   A list of all external links found within their subject's content.
        *   The cyber reputation assessment for each link.
        *   The original location (e.g., specific document, page name) of the reference within the LMS content.

**Extension Activity Features (Advanced):**

*   **Content Localization & Repository Management:**
    *   Optionally copies publicly accessible external content (e.g., articles, images) to a controlled local repository.
    *   Modifies the LMS content to point to this locally stored version.
*   **Academic Referencing:**
    *   For localized content, automatically generates academic references (e.g., APA 7th edition, or the University standard) including available metadata like date/time accessed, author (if extractable).
    *   Embeds these references alongside the localized content in the LMS.
*   **Original Link Preservation & Warnings:**
    *   Maintains a clearly marked link to the original external material for verification and authentication by the end-user.
    *   For links pointing to paywalled or controlled-access third-party sites (where content cannot be legally copied locally):
        *   Does *not* copy the content.
        *   Instead, presents a prominent warning message to the LMS user about accessing third-party content before redirecting or providing the direct link.

**General Features:**

*   **Organized Output:** Saves downloaded materials, reports, and logs in a structured directory format.
*   **Configurable:** Easily set up LMS credentials, target courses, download paths, API keys, and reporting preferences.
*   **Respectful Scraping:** Implements configurable delays between requests to avoid overloading the LMS or external servers.

## ‚ùó Ethical Use, ToS & Data Handling

**VERY IMPORTANT:**
*   ** University ToS & Policy:** This tool directly interacts with the University's LMS. Ensure its development and use are aligned with  University's IT policies and the LMS Terms of Service. **Obtain necessary approvals if required.**
*   **Copyright & Fair Use (for Extension Activity):** When copying external content, be acutely aware of copyright laws and fair use principles. This feature should primarily target publicly accessible, open content or content where  University has appropriate licenses.
*   **Third-Party ToS:** Scraping third-party websites also has implications. Be respectful and check their `robots.txt` and ToS.
*   **Data Privacy:** Handle LMS credentials and any scraped student data (if inadvertently encountered) with utmost confidentiality and in compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., FERPA).
*   **Reputation Service API Limits:** Be mindful of API rate limits for the chosen cyber reputation service.
*   **This script is intended for official use by authorized  University personnel.** The developers are not responsible for any misuse or policy violations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Access credentials for the  University LMS (with appropriate permissions).
*   API Key for the chosen Cyber Reputation Service (e.g., VirusTotal API Key).
*   (For extension activity) A designated local repository/server space for storing cached content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rayngnpc/lms-scraper-sele.git
    cd lms-scraper-sele
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run The Script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *(You will need to add libraries for document parsing like `python-docx`, `pypdf2` or `pdfminer.six`, `openpyxl`, etc. to your `requirements.txt` depending on the file types you need to analyze).*

Save the .gitignore file.
